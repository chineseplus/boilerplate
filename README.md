# boilerplate

> The `boilerplate` project is to explore technology stack for future builds of a Chinese learning platform. Currently there isn't a clear roadmap, for convenience, everything would be put in a single repository. But there would be 4 repositories before staging, all related to 鹅(é), namely, `Swan` (Frontend), `Goose` (Backend), `Gosling` (Admin), `Penguin` (Hybrid APP).

> I'll explain why I picked this `é` naming series when they're ready for production(hopefully they would be)

## Folders

* [x] **admin**: based on [vue-element-admin](https://github.com/PanJiaChen/vue-element-admin), so for now it would be a Vue 2 project
* [ ] **web**: preferably Nuxt, for SEO of course, [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/) is still in RC stage, let's see how it's going
* [ ] **server**: Spring is awesome, unfortunately I'm not an expert in Java, though I'm not an expert in Go neither, but the learning curve would be less steep and it seems that it's more popular among startups
