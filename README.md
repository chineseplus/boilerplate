# boilerplate

> The `boilerplate` project is to explore technology stack for future builds of a Chinese learning platform. Currently there isn't a clear roadmap, for convenience, everything would be put in a single repository. But there would be 4 repositories before staging, all related to 鹅(é), namely, `Swan` (Frontend), `Goose` (Backend), `Gosling` (Admin), `Penguin` (Hybrid APP). 
>   
> I'll explain where I picked this `é` naming series when they're ready for production(hopefully they would be)

## Folders

* **admin**: based on [vue-element-admin](https://github.com/PanJiaChen/vue-element-admin), so for now it would be a Vue 2 project
* **web**: preferably Nuxt, for SEO of course, [Nuxt 3](https://v3.nuxtjs.org/) is still in RC stage, let's see how it's going
* **server**: I'm not an expert in Java, so I'll definitely go with Golang
